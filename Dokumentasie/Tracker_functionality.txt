Overview of Tracker Fleet Management API Functionality
Integrating with a telematics provider like Tracker allows an application to access a rich stream of data directly from the vehicles. Here is a breakdown of the typical features and data points available through their fleet management and telematics APIs.

1. Real-Time Vehicle Tracking
This is the core feature of any telematics system. The API would allow you to:

Get Live Location: Fetch the real-time GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of any vehicle in the fleet.

Track Vehicle Status: See if a vehicle's ignition is on or off.

Monitor Speed and Direction: Get the current speed and heading of the vehicle. This is useful for ETAs and safety monitoring.

2. Historical Trip Data
APIs typically provide access to historical data, which is invaluable for analytics and reporting.

Trip Replays: Retrieve a detailed history of a vehicle's movements over a specific period, including the route taken, stops made, and speed at various points.

Stop/Stay Reports: Generate reports detailing where and for how long a vehicle was stationary. This is useful for verifying deliveries or analyzing driver downtime.

Distance Reports: Get the total distance traveled by a vehicle or the entire fleet over a given time frame.

3. Driver Behavior Monitoring
This functionality is crucial for improving safety, reducing wear and tear on vehicles, and lowering fuel costs.

Harsh Events: Receive alerts for harsh acceleration, braking, and cornering.

Speeding Alerts: Get notified when a driver exceeds a predefined speed limit or the national speed limit.

Idling Time: Monitor how long a vehicle is left idling, which helps in managing fuel consumption.

4. Geofencing
Geofencing allows you to create virtual perimeters around real-world geographic areas.

Create & Manage Geofences: Programmatically define geofences (e.g., around client sites, distribution centers, or restricted areas).

Entry/Exit Alerts: Receive notifications whenever a vehicle enters or leaves a defined geofence. This is perfect for automating arrival/departure logs for your client sites.

5. Vehicle Diagnostics & Maintenance (OBD-II Data)
If the Tracker unit is connected to the vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port, the API can provide a wealth of information.

Odometer Readings: Get accurate mileage for maintenance scheduling.

Fuel Level & Consumption: Monitor fuel levels in real-time and analyze consumption patterns.

Engine Hours: Track engine run time, which is another key metric for planning maintenance.

Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs): Be alerted to engine fault codes, allowing for proactive maintenance before a small issue becomes a major breakdown.

Battery Voltage: Monitor the health of the vehicle's battery.

6. Security and Alerting
Panic Button: Receive an immediate alert if a driver activates a panic button in the vehicle.

Unauthorized Movement: Get notified if a vehicle is moved without the ignition being turned on (i.e., being towed).

Stolen Vehicle Recovery (SVR): While the recovery process is handled by Tracker, the API can flag a vehicle as stolen, which could trigger lockdowns or other protocols within your app.

Integration Potential for Your App
By integrating this data, you could:

Display truck locations on your existing maps for both admins and clients.

Automate logbooks by using trip and geofence data.

Provide accurate ETAs to clients based on a truck's live location.

Create a driver scoring system based on behavior data.

Send proactive maintenance alerts based on odometer readings or fault codes.

When you meet with the business owner, a great starting point would be to ask which Tracker subscription package they have, as this will determine which of these API features are available to them.
