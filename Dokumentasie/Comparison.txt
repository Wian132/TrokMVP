Historical Data: Access to extensive trip histories, logbooks, and detailed reports.

Driver Behavior: Advanced driver monitoring with scoring and real-time alerts for poor driving habits.

Geofencing: Full capabilities for creating and managing geofences and associated rules.

Vehicle Diagnostics (OBD-II): Integration with the vehicle's CAN bus provides rich data on fuel, maintenance, and vehicle health.

Asset & Trailer Tracking: Often provides specialized API endpoints for non-powered assets, which could be relevant for tracking trailers.

4. Mix Telematics
Mix Telematics is a global leader, particularly strong in the large commercial and industrial fleet sectors (e.g., trucking, mining, oil & gas). Their API is designed for heavy-duty use and complex data analysis.

Key Strengths: Expertise in large-scale enterprise fleets, focus on safety and compliance (e.g., trucking regulations), and highly customizable solutions.

API Functionality:

Real-Time Data: High-frequency position updates and detailed vehicle status information suitable for logistics and dispatch.

Historical Data: Advanced reporting and data extraction for in-depth analysis of fleet performance.

Driver Behavior & Safety: A core focus. API provides access to detailed event data, driver scoring, and integration with camera systems (e.g., AI-powered event detection).

Compliance: Features designed to help with regulations, such as tracking driving hours (Hours of Service).

Vehicle Diagnostics (OBD-II): Deep integration with various vehicle types to pull extensive diagnostic and performance data.

Satellite Communication: For fleets operating in remote areas, their solutions often include satellite communication, and the API can provide location data even when out of cellular range.

Conclusion for Your Meeting
You can confidently state that no matter which of these top-tier providers the business owner uses, API integration is almost certainly an option. The key question for him will be which data package or subscription level he has, as this determines which API endpoints are enabled for his account.
